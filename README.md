# CO2 Emissions

This project analyses the C02 Emissions by country from 1750 to 2017.

**Data Set**

This data set is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yoannboyere/co2-ghg-emissionsdata).

It contains 4 variables: Country, Code, Year and Annual CO2 Emission in tonnes. Each row each row gives us an emission value for a given country at a given year.

**Summary**

After cleaning the data by removing the Code column, I have developed a function that graphically displays the CO2 emissions according to the selected country.

The country with the highest total CO2 emissions from 1750 to 2017 is the United States. Although in 2017 the country with the highest annual emissions is China followed by the United States.
